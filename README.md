This project was bootstrapped with [Create React Native App](https://github.com/react-community/create-react-native-app).

It is one of two app developed for my MSc dissertation. 
The other app has the same features and can be found here: [Kotlin App](https://github.com/MrStobbart/lyric-quiz-kotlin).

The branach [master-ejected](https://github.com/MrStobbart/lyric-quiz-react-native/tree/master-ejected) is the ejected create-react-native-app project should be used to install the app on your phone.
